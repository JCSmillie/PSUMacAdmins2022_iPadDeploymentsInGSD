# PSUMacAdmins2022_iPadDeploymentsInGSD
 PSU MacAdmins 2022 Presentation on iPad Deployments in GSD using Mosyle

Slides and example scripts from presentation given for Penn State MacAdmins 2022 Camp Fire sessions about how we deploy our iPads with Mosyle and various custom scripts, things we do in the classroom to help our students better understand how to take care of the iPad, and our future endevors with the Jr Gator IT Help Desk.

This presentation was originally given on July 7th, 2022 virtually for PSU MacAdmins.

The slides from the Keynote will be posted AFTER the presentation (same day.)  This is because there are a few things we tweaked right up to the minute before we presented!

While I did do a live demo of Shake N' Bake during the camp fire session I do have another video of ShakeNBake doing its thing which can be found on my Google Drive.  It was too big to through on a Github in a nice mannor.
